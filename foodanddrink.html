<h1> Diet </h1>
<p>In terms of diet, pay attention to a balanced diet and consume more vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains and healthy oils, such as those contained in nuts and deep-sea fish.<br>
At the same time, you should eat less red meat such as beef, mutton, and pork, as well as processed meat such as sausage and bacon. </p>

<h1> Drinking Water </h1>
<p>Water keeps every system in the body functioning properly. The Harvard Medical School Special Health Report 6-Week Plan for Health Eating notes that water has many important jobs, such as:
</p>
<p>-> Carrying nutrients and oxygen to your cells
-> Flushing bacteria from your bladder
-> Aiding digestion
-> Preventing constipation
-> Normalizing blood pressure
-> Cushioning joints
-> Protecting organs and tissues
-> Regulating body temperature
-> Maintaining electrolyte (sodium) balance.</p>

<p>You should also pay attention to avoid consuming sugary drinks as much as possible, especially the milk tea that everyone loves to drink now.<br><br>

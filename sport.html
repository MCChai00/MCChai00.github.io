<h1> Diet </h1>
<p>
Maintaining a healthy diet is an important part of developing a healthy lifestyle.<br>
  First of all, we should pay attention to a balanced diet.<br>
  This means we should eat a variety of different types of food, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, protein, and healthy fats.<br>
  This ensures that we get enough nutrients and maintains normal body functions.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we should control our food intake.<br>
  Excessive food intake can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of chronic disease.<br>
  We can control portion size by using small plates, chewing food slowly, and avoiding snacking.<br>
  Additionally, we should avoid overreliance on processed foods and high-sugar drinks, as they often contain high calories and unhealthy ingredients.<br>

<h1> Drinking Water </h1>
<p>Water keeps every system in the body functioning properly. The Harvard Medical School Special Health Report 6-Week Plan for Health Eating notes that water has many important jobs, such as:
</p>
<p>
> Carrying nutrients and oxygen to your cells<br>
> Flushing bacteria from your bladder<br>
> Aiding digestion<br>
> Preventing constipation<br>
> Normalizing blood pressure<br>
> Cushioning joints<br>
> Protecting organs and tissues<br>
> Regulating body temperature<br>
> Maintaining electrolyte (sodium) balance<br></p>

<p>You should also pay attention to avoid consuming sugary drinks as much as possible, especially the milk tea that everyone loves to drink now.<br><br>

<h1> Sport </h1>
<p>
Exercise has many benefits for our physical and mental health.<br>
  First, regular exercise can help us control our weight and enhance muscle and bone health. <br>
  In addition, exercise can improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.<br>
<br>
Secondly, exercise also has a positive impact on mental health. Exercise can release stress and anxiety and improve mood and well-being.<br>
  In addition, regular exercise can also improve sleep quality and reduce the occurrence of insomnia.<br>
<br>
To incorporate exercise into our daily lives, we can choose activities we enjoy such as walking, running, swimming or yoga. <br>
  We can also participate in team sports or fitness classes with friends to increase the fun and motivation of exercise.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we should control our food intake.<br>
  Excessive food intake can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of chronic disease.<br>
  We can control portion size by using small plates, chewing food slowly, and avoiding snacking.<br>
  Additionally, we should avoid overreliance on processed foods and high-sugar drinks, as they often contain high calories and unhealthy ingredients.<br>

<h1> DIET </h1>

<div>In terms of diet, pay attention to a balanced diet and consume more vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains and healthy oils, such as those contained in nuts and deep-sea fish.<br>
At the same time, you should eat less red meat such as beef, mutton, and pork, as well as processed meat such as sausage and bacon. <br>

You should also pay attention to avoid consuming sugary drinks as much as possible, especially the milk tea that everyone loves to drink now.<br></div>

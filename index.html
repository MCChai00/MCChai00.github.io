<h1> Diet </h1>
In terms of diet, pay attention to a balanced diet and consume more vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains and healthy oils, such as those contained in nuts and deep-sea fish.<br>
At the same time, you should eat less red meat such as beef, mutton, and pork, as well as processed meat such as sausage and bacon. <br>

<h1> Drinking Water </h1>
Water keeps every system in the body functioning properly. The Harvard Medical School Special Health Report 6-Week Plan for Health Eating notes that water has many important jobs, such as:

Carrying nutrients and oxygen to your cells
Flushing bacteria from your bladder
Aiding digestion
Preventing constipation
Normalizing blood pressure
Cushioning joints
Protecting organs and tissues
Regulating body temperature
Maintaining electrolyte (sodium) balance.<br>

You should also pay attention to avoid consuming sugary drinks as much as possible, especially the milk tea that everyone loves to drink now.<br>
